# Etch-Sketch


A basic exercise using Javascript to manipulate the DOM and alter CSS.

The aim was to create a square board made up of 16 by 16 "tiles".
Initially when the mouse passes over a tile it changes colour. If the tile 
has already changed colour, each subsequent time the mouse passes over the tile
it becomes 10% darker until finally turning black. 

A button can be used to change the tile width and height on the board (up to 100).
The board must still be a square and it's size must stay the same (in this case 500px by 500px.)
